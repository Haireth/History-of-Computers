          1801: Joseph Marie Jacquard, a French merchant and inventor invents a
          loom that uses punched wooden cards to automatically weave fabric
          designs. Early computers would use similar punch cards.

          1821: English mathematician Charles Babbage conceives of a
          steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables
          of numbers. Funded by the British government, the project, called the
          "Difference Engine" fails due to the lack of technology at the time,
          according to the University of Minnesota.

          1936: Alan Turing, a British scientist and mathematician, presents the
          principle of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, in
          a paper called "On Computable Numbers…" according to Chris Bernhardt's
          book "Turing's Vision" (The MIT Press, 2017). Turing machines are
          capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept
          of the modern computer is based on his ideas.

          highlights the Altair 8080 as the "world's first minicomputer kit to
          rival commercial models." After seeing the magazine issue, two
          "computer geeks," Paul Allen and Bill Gates, offer to write software
          for the Altair, using the new BASIC language.
